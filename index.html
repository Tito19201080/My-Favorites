    <h3>What Is it?</h3>
    <p>
      Pc building is basically building and constructing new pc's (aka personal
      computers) it is using new or used parts to construct a powerful or
      resourceful computer.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Do I Like It?</h3>
    <p>
      I like building pc's because of its various interkit parts, I find it fun
      being able to fully customizse a personal computer for me or someone else,
      I have had 2 personal computers of my own, my first was an old Optiplex
      9020 which I used for gaming and other stuff like school or digial design
      like 3D. Later on I got a proper gaming pc, a ROG prebuilt computer from
      one of my friends, ive taken apart the optiplex as it needed some
      cleaning, i havent taken apart the new one as it is a little bit more
      risky as it has much more valuble parts than the optiplex, but I will have
      to take it apart soon as it is accumulating quite a bit of dust now. If

    <h3>What Is It?</h3>
    <p>
      Pc gaming is a from of gaming that is done on a computer, not just pcs but
      can also be a laptop, generally involves the use of a computer and is
      different than typical gaming on a console with a controller.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Do I Like It?</h3>
    <p>
      I like to play games in general, it is fun and exhilerating, but pc gaming
      is my favourite as it is much different than console gaming, for example
      on a console you use a controller where as on you pc you use your keyboard
      and mouse, which in my opinion is much easier than playing on a
      controller, certain games do require a keyboard and mouse due to the high
      amount of buttons that can be binded. pc games also have a wider selection
      as most console games are on pc as pc's are much more capable and powerful
      than any console manufactured, certain games also have modding
      capabilities which with some games can make the game feel new again where
      as console doesnt support modding. If you want to learn how to get started

    <h3>Some Key Points I Learned When Playing Pc Games</h3>
    <ol>
      Try not to spend to much time playing and give breaks as prolonged
      exposure to a screen could be damaging.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Most modern games reqire a very powerful pc, a $1500 pc at most can run
      most modern games on medium graphics settings.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Certain games require somewhat expensive equipment, keyboard and mouse to
      prevent latency or input delay.
